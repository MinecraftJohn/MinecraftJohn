I am currently a Computer Engineering college student. I really like the feeling when I am designing UI for website. Mainly focusing on front-end web development, but also diving into back-end and UI design from time to time.
<br><br>
Currently, I keep my self learning JavaScript and PHP until I reach the average mastery of it before making a project that anyone can benefit from it 😁. I am planning to learn Java one day to make my own Minecraft plugins for my server.
<br><br>
So far, I have made the basic 4 basic functionality of server side (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) I learned a lot from this project. Feel free to suggest and report issues, repositories are open to contributions!
