            Hello, they call me MinecraftJohn and I make amazing things for the web, from design to development.
            <br />
            <br />I started my web development journey in 2017, when I created a website for my game server using a
            website builder. However, I was not satisfied with the limited customization options. Therefore, I decided
            to learn HTML and CSS, which are markup languages that allow me to create beautiful and responsive websites.
            Since then, I have never stopped improving my web development skills. In addition, I have learned
            JavaScript, React, and TailwindCSS, which are powerful technologies for creating interactive and
            user-friendly web applications. You can check out some of the websites I have created on my GitHub profile.{" "}

            If you have any questions or feedback for me, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear from
            you. ðŸ˜Š
